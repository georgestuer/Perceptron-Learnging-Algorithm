PLA (Using Python)

Overview

This project follows the description of the perceptron learning algorithm and shows that this learning algorithm can be used to classify the data points generated by uniform distribution.

Repo contents

●	training.py: This file contains all the code to generate training data in required format and put it into a txt file called “train.txt”.

●	PLA.py: This script file takes train.txt as input and then output the trained weight using PLA.

Installation Dependencies:

●	Python 3.7

●	Windows 10

Included libraries

●	Numpy

●	Random

●	Matplotlib

●	re

How to Run?

1.	Run training.py and type w0, w1, w2, m, n (use space or comma or other Separator symbol to separate the input)

2.	Run PLA.py
